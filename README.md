This is diabetes predictor model, which is under development and achieved a best test accuracy of 79.56%.
The use of MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron) is done to build the architect of the neural network.
The aim of our model is to predict diabetes, with the given parameters like
blood sugar,diabetes pedigree function,etc.
For the time being the main goal is to improve the test accuracy of the model.
